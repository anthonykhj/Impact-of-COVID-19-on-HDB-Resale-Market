# Impact of COVID-19 on HDB Resale Market
A Python-based analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on HDB's resale market using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn

## ðŸ“Œ Overview 
This project analyses the relationship between Singapore's public housing market and COVID-19 by using datasets from the Housing Development Board (HDB) and Our World in Data. Through Python's data science stack **(Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**, the project:
- Processes real-world CSV datasets from [HDB's](https://data.gov.sg/datasets?agencies=Housing+%26+Development+Board+(HDB)) and [Our World in Data's](https:/ourworldindata.org) open-data portals.
- Generates statistical insights using **Pandas** and visualisations using **Matplotlib/Seaborn**.
